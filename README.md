# Katas

## The Kata

What makes a good practice session? You need time without interruptions, and a simple thing you want to try. You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes. You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve. There needs to be no pressure: this is why it is hard to practice in a project environment. it helps to keep it fun: make small steps forward when you can. Finally, you’ll recognize a good practice session because you’ll came out of it knowing more than when you went in.

[Code Kata](http://codekata.com/) is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long).

## Info

The `instructions/` directory contains the requirements for each kata. In `src/` and `tests/` are the implementations.

I am going to start by doing the exercises of this year's [AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/en) organised by [midudev](https://www.twitch.tv/midudev).

## Run it

```bash
npm install

npm run build

npm test
```
